# nlight
natural lighting system

The goal is to strike a balance between the human daily sleep cycle, and the natural daily light cycle.

sun_calc - provides us with calculated information about nautical events given a lat/long. 
This is really useful because there are no calls to external services.

node_hue_api - really good wrapper of the phillips hue api. Provides all the functionality to interact with the hue bridge and bulbs. Looks well maintained.

User interface - non existant. Look at logs. Recommend '>forever' to manage app life cycle.
